# operator-overloading-2DGeometry
# 🧮 Geometry Toolkit in C++

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates how to work with 2D geometry using object-oriented programming. It models basic geometric concepts such as **Points** and **Lines**, and performs operations like:

- Calculating **length** between two points
- Finding the **midpoint** of a line segment
- Calculating the **slope** of a line
- Displaying the **equation of a line**
- Using **operator overloading** for intuitive syntax

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── geometry.h      # Header file defining the Point and Line classes
├── main.cpp        # Driver program to test functionalities
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Access specifiers (private, protected, public)**
- **Friend functions**
- **Operator Overloading**
- **Function overloading**
- **Constructor initializer lists**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Basic math (distance, midpoint, slope, line equation)**

## 📌 Example Output

```
Length: 1.41421
Midpoint : (2.5, 3.5)
Slope of the line passing through (2, 3) and (3, 4) : 1
Equation : y -1x = 1
```
